# minimalist g8 project template for a finch microservice

Forked from [bneil's](https://github.com/bneil/finch-skeleton.g8), slimmed down, & updated dependencies.

## Requirements

`sbt -sbt-version 0.13.16 new nicosuave/finch-skeleton.g8`

## Why Use Finch?

Because the reader monad is pretty sweet and trying out this whole server as a function is a neat application
